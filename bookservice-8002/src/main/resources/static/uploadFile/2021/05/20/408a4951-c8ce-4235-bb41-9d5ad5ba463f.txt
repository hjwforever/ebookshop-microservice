Airplane Ticket Distribution software test cases design.	

          Suppose you are to design a ticket distributor software for one airplane company in Beijing. In the software development process, the use case for purchasing tickets is already written and accepted by the client. It describes a "normal" interaction between a Passenger and the Distributor:
Flow of events:		
     1. Passenger selects a number of zones to be traveled. If he presses multiple zone buttons, Distributor only considers the last button pressed.
     2. The Distributor displays the amount due.
     3. The Passenger inserts money.
     4. If the Passenger selects a new zone before inserting sufficient money, the Distributor returns all coins and bills already inserted.
     5. If Passenger inserted more money than the amount due, the Distributor returns excess change.
     6. The Distributor issues the ticket.
     7. The Passenger picks up the change and the ticket.
Exit condition: The Passenger has picked up the selected ticket.
